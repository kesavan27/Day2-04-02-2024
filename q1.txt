Window Object

The Window object is a global object in client-side JavaScript,
 representing the browser window containing a DOM document and 
acting as the root of the document object model.

The window object, supported by all browsers, represents 
the browser’s window and automatically includes global JavaScript objects, 
functions, and variables as members.

Document Object

The Document object is the HTML document that appears in the browser window and serves as 
an interface for interacting with the web page’s content. 
The browser generates a Document Object Model of a web page upon loading it.
